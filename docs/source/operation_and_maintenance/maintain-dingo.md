DingoAdm Common Operations
===

Viewing the Cluster List
---

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster ls
```

To display cluster details, add the `-v` option, which displays information about the `cluster ID`, `cluster UUID`, `cluster creation time`, `cluster description`, and so on:

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster ls -v
```

Switching clusters
---

Switches the specified cluster to the current managed cluster. After switching a cluster, all subsequent operations will work on that cluster.

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster checkout < cluster-name>
```

After switching clusters, when you look at the cluster list again, a `*` icon will appear in front of the current cluster name, which we use to identify the current operating cluster.

Add Cluster
---

Users can specify the cluster topology file while adding a cluster, or they can add a cluster first and then submit the cluster topology by [Modify Cluster Topology](#Modify_Cluster_Topology):

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster add < cluster-name> [-f topology.yaml]
```

Delete Cluster
---

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster rm <cluster-name>
```

> :warning: **Warning:**
>
> After deleting a cluster, all information related to the cluster will be erased, please be careful. `dingoadm` supports managing multiple clusters at the same time, please do not delete a cluster if it is not necessary.

Export Cluster
---

We can save the current cluster information as a local file, usually we need to export the cluster in the following 2 cases:
*  Cluster information needs to be backed up on a regular basis to prevent its loss
*  Sharing cluster information with other users for other users to operate the cluster

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster export <cluster-name> [-o database-file-path]
```

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> The exported cluster file is keyed by the cluster `UUID`, which is globally unique, and the value holds the following 2 types of information:
> *  Cluster service configuration, i.e., cluster topology
> *  Information about each service, including the service ID, the container ID on which the service is running, etc.

Import Cluster
---

```shell
$ dingoadm cluster import < cluster-name> [-f database-file-path]
```

> 📢 **Note:**
> *  The cluster name specified when importing a cluster must not duplicate an existing cluster name, otherwise the import will fail
> *  Importing a cluster imports the cluster topology intact, so some configuration items may be invalidated, such as the SSH private key path configuration item `private_key_path`.
> In this case, users can modify the cluster topology and commit to operate the cluster normally.

Viewing Cluster Topology
---

```shell
$ dingoadm config show
```

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> When the local topology file is lost, we can recover it by saving the current cluster topology:
> ```shell
> $ dingoadm config show > topology.yaml
> ```

Modifying the Cluster Topology
---

Modify the local cluster topology:

```shell
$ vim topology.yaml
```

Once we have modified our local topology file, we need to submit our changes to DingoAdm for the cluster topology to take effect:

```shell
$ dingoadm config commit < topology.yaml>
```

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> When submitting the local cluster topology, the terminal will display the difference between the local cluster topology and the current cluster topology, so please compare carefully to prevent incorrect submission.

Comparing Cluster Topologies
---

We can view the differences between the local cluster topology file and the current cluster topology by using the following command:

```shell
$ dingoadm config diff < topology.yaml>
```

Viewing Cluster Status
---

```shell
$ dingoadm status
```

DingoAdm displays the Service ID, Service Role, Hostname, Number of Deployed Replication Services, Container ID, and Running Status by default:

```shell
Get Service Status: [OK]

cluster name      : my-cluster
cluster kind      : dingofs
cluster mds addr  : 10.0.1.1:6666,10.0.1.2:6666,10.0.1.3:6666
cluster mds leader: 10.0.1.1:6666 / 505da008b59c

```

* If you want to see the rest of the information, such as listening ports, log directories, data directories, etc., you can add the `-v` parameter.
*  For [replicas][replicas] services on the same host, the status is collapsed by default, and the `-s` parameter can be added to display each replica service

Starting services
---

```shell
$ dingoadm start
```

DingoAdm starts all services in the cluster by default. If you want to start a specific service, you can do so by adding the following 3 options:

*  `--id': Starts the service with the specified `id'.
*  `--host`: Starts all services on the specified host.
*  `--role`: Starts all services in the specified role.

The above 3 options can be used in any combination, and the corresponding `id`, `host`, and `role` of the service can be viewed via [dingoadm status](#Client_Status).

#### Example 1: Starting service with id `c9570c0d0252`

```shell
$ dingoadm start --id c9570c0d0252
```

#### Example 2: Starting All `MDS` Services on the `10.0.1.1` Host
```shell
$ dingoadm start --host 10.0.1.1 --role mds
```
<a id="Discontinuation"></a>
Discontinuation of services
---

```shell
$ dingoadm stop
```

DingoAdm stops all services in the cluster by default, if you want to stop a specific service, you can do so by adding the following 3 options:

*  `--id': Stop the service with the specified `id'.
*  `--host`: Stop all services on the specified host.
*  `--role`: stops all services for the specified role

The above 3 options can be used in any combination, and the corresponding `id`, `host`, and `role` of the service can be viewed via [dingoadm status](#Client_Status).

#### Example 1: Stopping a service with id `c9570c0d0252`

```shell
$ dingoadm stop --id c9570c0d0252
```

#### Example 2: Stopping All `MDS` Services on the `10.0.1.1` Host
```shell
$ dingoadm stop --host 10.0.1.1 --role mds
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:**
>
> Stopping the service may cause an unhealthy cluster and result in client IO failures, so please proceed with caution.

<a id="Restart"></a>
Restart sth.
---

```shell
$ dingoadm restart
```

DingoAdm restarts all services in the cluster by default. If you want to restart a specific service, you can do so by adding the following 3 options:

*  `--id': restarts the service with the specified `id'.
*  `--host`: Restarts all services on the specified host.
*  `--role`: restarts all services for the specified role

The above 3 options can be used in any combination, and the corresponding `id`, `host`, and `role` of the service can be viewed via [dingoadm status](#Client_Status).

#### Example 1: Restarting a service with id `c9570c0d0252`

```shell
$ dingoadm restart --id c9570c0d0252
```

#### Example 2: Restarting All `MDS` Services on the `10.0.1.1` Host
```shell
$ dingoadm restart --host 10.0.1.1 --role mds
```

Modifying the Service Configuration
---

During cluster operation, we may need to modify the configuration of the service and restart the service. The steps are as follows:

#### Step 1: Edit the local cluster topology file and modify the configuration entries for the corresponding services

```shell
$ vim topology.yaml
```

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> When the local topology file is lost, we can recover it by saving the current cluster topology:
> ```shell
> $ dingoadm config show > topology.yaml
> ```

#### Step 2: Submit changes
```shell
$ dingoadm config commit topology.yaml
```

#### Step 3: Reload Services

```shell
$ dingoadm reload
```

DingoAdm reloads all services in the cluster by default, if you want to reload a specific service, you can do so by adding the following 3 options:

*  `--id`: Reloads the service with the specified `id`.
*  `--host`: Reloads all services on the specified host.
*  `--role`: Reloads all services for the specified role

The above 3 options can be used in any combination, and the corresponding `id`, `host`, and `role` of the service can be viewed via [dingoadm status](#Client_Status).

#### Example 1: Reloading the service with id `c9570c0d0252`

```shell
$ dingoadm reload --id c9570c0d0252
```

#### Example 2: Reloading all `MDS` services on the `10.0.1.1` host
```shell
$ dingoadm reload --host 10.0.1.1 --role mds
```

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> The difference between the command [restart](#Restart) and `reload` is that the
> `reload` modifies the configuration of the corresponding service based on the current cluster topology changes, and then restarts the service.
> `restart` simply restarts the service.

Entering the Service Container
---

We can remotely go inside the service container and view information about the service processes, configuration, logs, data, etc.:.

```shell
$ dingoadm enter < id>
```

The `id` corresponding to a service can be viewed via [dingoadm status](#Client_Status).

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> DingoAdm defaults to the root directory of the service. The service root directory contains all the files required by the service and has the following directory structure:
>
> ```shell
> /dingofs/mds  # Service root directory
>| -- conf      # Configuration directory
>|   ` -- mds.conf
>| -- data      # Data catalogue
>| -- logs      # Log directory
>|   ` -- dingofs-mds.log.INFO.20220120-142115.6
>` -- sbin      # Binary directory
>    ` -- dingofs-mds
> ```

Clean up the cluster
---

```shell
$ dingoadm clean
```

DingoAdm cleans up all objects of all services in the cluster by default. If you want to clean up a specific service or object, you can do so by adding the following 4 options:

*  `--id`: Cleans up the service corresponding to the specified `id`.
*  `--host`: Cleans up the services corresponding to the specified host.
*  `--role`: cleans up the services corresponding to the specified role
*  `--only`: clean up the specified objects (`log`: log, `data`: data, `container`: container)

The above 4 options can be used in any combination, and the corresponding `id`, `host`, and `role` of the service can be viewed via [dingoadm status](#Client_Status).

#### Example 1: Cleaning up all objects with id `c9570c0d0252` service

```shell
$ dingoadm clean --id c9570c0d0252
```

#### Example 2: Cleaning up logs and data from all MDS services

```shell
$ dingoadm clean --role mds --only log,data
```

#### Example 3: Cleaning up all objects of the `MDS` service on the `10.0.1.1` host

```shell
$ dingoadm clean --host 10.0.1.1 --role mds
```

> 📢 **Note:**
>
> When cleaning up a service container, make sure that the corresponding service is stopped; you can use the [stop](#Discontinuation) command to stop the specified service.

<a id="Client_Status"></a>
Viewing Client Status
---

```shell
$ dingoadm client status
```

DingoAdm displays the Client ID, Client Type, Host, Container ID, Running Status, and Auxiliary information by default:

```shell
Get Client Status: [OK]

Id            Kind     Host          Container Id  Status       Aux Info
--            ----     ----          ------------  ------       --------

c700e1f6acab  dingofs  server-host3  52554173a54f  Up 36 hours  {"user":"dingofs","volume":"/test3"}
```


Entering the Client Container
---

We can remotely go inside the service container and view information about client processes, configuration, logs, data, etc:.

```shell
$ dingoadm client < id>
```

The corresponding `id` of the client can be viewed via [dingoadm client status](#Client_Status).

> 💡 **Reminder:**
>
> DingoAdm defaults to the root directory of this client. The client root directory contains all the files required by the service and has the following directory structure:
>
> ```shell
> /dingofs/client # Service root directory
>| -- conf      # Configuration directory
>|   ` -- client.conf
>| -- data      # Data catalogue
>| -- logs      # Log directory
>|   ` -- dingofs-client.log.INFO.20220120-142115.6
