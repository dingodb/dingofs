# DingoFS

[DingoFS](https://github.com/dingodb/dingofs) is a cloud-native distributed high-speed file storage system designed and developed by [DataCanvas](https://www.datacanvas.com/). It integrates multiple features such as elasticity, multi-cloud compatibility, multi-protocol convergence, and exceptional performance.By leveraging its multi-tiered, multi-type, and high-performance distributed multi-level caching architecture, DingoFS accelerates data I/O for AI workflows, effectively addressing burst I/O challenges in AI scenarios. Additionally, it provides local cache storage capabilities to meet the full lifecycle storage requirements of large-scale AI models.

## Key Features

**1. POSIX Compliance**

DingoFS delivers a native file system-like operational experience, enabling seamless system integration.

**2. AI-Native Architecture**

Deeply optimized for large language model (LLM) workflows, efficiently managing massive training datasets and checkpoint workloads.

**3. S3 Protocol Compatibility**

DingoFS supports standard S3 interface protocols for streamlined access to filesystem namespace resources.

**4. Fully Distributed Architecture**

DingoFS's metadata Service (MDS), data storage layer, caching system, and client components all support linear scalability.

**5. Exceptional Performance**

Combines SSD-level low-latency responsiveness with object storage-grade elastic throughput capacity.

**6. Intelligent Caching Acceleration System**

DingFS implements a three-tier caching topology (memory/local SSD/distributed cluster) to deliver high-throughput, low-latency intelligent I/O acceleration for AI workloads.

### Network
Deploying a cluster via DingoAdm requires the following two network prerequisites:

- The control machine where DingoAdm is installed must have SSH access to the target servers for service deployment.

- All servers must be able to pull images from the Docker registry.


### Dependencies
DingoFS services run within Docker containers. Users must install Docker on each server and ensure the Docker Daemon is operational.
